**blau** is game where your goal is the simplest possible one: get to the end 
of each level. How? By guiding blau - actually, an abstract black circle - 
through many simple - yet elegant - puzzles, avoiding physics-based traps and collecting shapes; to every level, there are many solutions, which go from beautifully simple to deep and complex ones - **it all starts with a gesture, 
then evolves with physics, but the end is up to you**.
